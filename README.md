# Statistics about Urban cities
In England, both rural and urban areas have seen an increase in overall population between 2011 and 2019. Rural population increased by 5.2% and urban by 6.2%. Within rural areas, the greatest rate of population increase was in rural town and fringe areas (5.7%). Within urban areas it was in urban major conurbations (6.9%). In 2019, 56.3 million people lived in urban areas (82.9% of Englandâ€™s population) and 9.6 million in rural areas (17.1%).

In total 11 city regions had over 27 million residents in 2015, over 40% of the total UK population of 65 million. Population projections from 2015 to 2025 show city regions have a percentage growth rate of 7.6% compared to the UK growth rate of 6.7%.

# What is the purpose of this program?  
The main objective with this code is to visualise complex city data to facilitate better decision-making by city planners, policymakers, and stakeholders.

# What does this code present to the user?
It presents a population heatmap to display population density for various city areas, demographic bar charts to show the distribution of different demographic groups in each area and a traffic flow count to show traffic patterns throughout the day for better planning. 

# What does this program do with all the data gathered?
This program transforms raw city data into actionable insights through interactive and visually intuitive charts, promoting informed and efficient urban planning.

# If you were to make this into an actual app/website, what other features would you think adding?
As this is only a prototype, I decided to pick out some key bits of data that I believe affects most of the cities in the UK. If I was to have more time, I would add features to display data about pollution levels, more specifically what gases are in the environment and also a percentage of plants and other greenery in the area, to see if there needs to be an increase in plants to combat the greenhouse gases in the area.

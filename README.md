# MetroVision
# What is the purpose of this program?  
The main objective with this code is to visualise complex city data to facilitate better decision-making by city planners, policymakers, and stakeholders.

# What does this code present to the user?
It presents a population heatmap to display population density for various city areas, demographic bar charts to show the distribution of different demographic groups in each area and a traffic flow count to show traffic patterns throughout the day for better planning. 

# What does this program do with all the data gathered?
This program transforms raw city data into actionable insights through interactive and visually intuitive charts, promoting informed and efficient urban planning.

# If you were to make this into an actual app/website, what other features would you think adding?
As this is only a prototype, I decided to pick out some key bits of data that I believe affects most of the cities in the UK. If I was to have more time, I would add features to display data about pollution levels, more specifically what gases are in the environment and also a percentage of plants and other greenery in the area, to see if there needs to be an increase in plants to combat the greenhouse gases in the area.
